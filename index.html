            <h3>Where the data comes from</h3>
            <p class="credit">
                Place names and locations are derived from Ordnance Survey. 
                Place impressions are pre-generated by ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI, using batch API requests.
                Built areas under place labels are derived from OpenStreetMap. See the process in the
